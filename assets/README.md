# Trackball icon

`trackball.svg` is the approved simplified B design for MX Ergo: a solid ergonomic body, a large thumb ball, and one button divider. It was drawn as SVG for small status-bar sizes and is covered by the repository MIT license.

The white source is tinted with the active Omarchy foreground color in `BarWidget.qml`. The ball clearance and button divider are transparent cutouts. The SVG is bundled locally; displaying it makes no network requests.

The body is vertically compressed by 10% and centered in the canvas to match the neighboring bar icons. The thumb ball remains circular.

## Button diagram

`trackball-map.png` is the generated product illustration extracted from the approved third button-mapping concept. It has an alpha background and is bundled locally. The built-in image generator produced the cutout from the approved concept with the instruction to preserve the MX Ergo geometry and remove UI overlays and background.

`TrackballMap.qml` draws all labels, callout lines and selectable targets separately using the host theme. No assignment is baked into the image. Its normalized button coordinates refer to this exact 1024 × 1536 image, including transparent margins; replacing or cropping the image requires rechecking those coordinates.

The illustration identifies compatible hardware; Logitech and Logi marks belong to their respective owner. This community plugin is not an official Logitech application.

## Screenshots

`screenshots/original/` contains the supplied UI captures. `screenshots/qml-2x/` contains 2× images rendered from `ErgoPanel.qml` with test states matching those captures. The original and rendered files are kept separately so the two sources remain easy to compare. The root `preview.png` is the light-theme buttons render used by the Marketplace and README.

The screenshots show Logitech and Logi product marks for hardware identification. Those marks remain the property of their respective owners; the repository license does not grant rights to third-party marks. This community plugin is not an official Logitech application.
